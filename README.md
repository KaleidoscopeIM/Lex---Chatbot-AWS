# Lex---Chatbot-AWS
A chat bot using Amazon Lex, lambda function, and a web UI hosted in S3 and can be used for movie booking
Amazon Lex is a service for building conversational voice and text chatbot into any application. The project aims to design a chatbot using Amazon Lex, lambda function, and a web UI hosted in S3. Further, the chatbot can be embedded in any website using a simple javascript snippet.
The project is a chatbot where users can book movie tickets. It starts the booking process when user types or speaks in specific sentences such as ‘Book movie ticket for me’. The chatbot then asks multiple questions regarding the ticket booking, such as movie name, theater name, date, time, and the number of tickets. In the end, the chatbot also asks the mobile number. If the user confirms the ticket, then an SMS is sent to the user’s mobile number by having ticket details.
